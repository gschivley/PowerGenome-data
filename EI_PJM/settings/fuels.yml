# EIA AEO FUEL PRICE VARIABLES

# Which year of AEO to use. Note that different years have different scenario names
# so those may need to be modified accordingly.
fuel_data_year: 2025

# ============================================================================
# SIMPLIFIED APPROACH (RECOMMENDED)
# ============================================================================
# This test system uses the simplified fuel price workflow where the fuel price
# table already contains:
# - region: Model region names (p1, p2, p3, p4)
# - scenario: Scenario names matching fuel_scenarios below (reference)
# - fuel: Fuel names matching tech_fuel_map below (coal, naturalgas, distillate, uranium)
#
# With this approach, you don't need fuel_series_* or fuel_region_map parameters.
# PowerGenome will automatically:
# 1. Construct full_fuel_name as region_scenario_fuel (e.g., p1_reference_coal)
# 2. Average base region prices for aggregated regions (e.g., p1_2 from p1 and p2)

# ============================================================================
# FUEL ASSIGNMENTS (REQUIRED)
# ============================================================================
# Assign scenario names to base fuels. These names should match the 'scenario'
# column values in your fuel price table.
fuel_scenarios:
  coal: no_111d # The reference coal scenario has most plants retiring
  naturalgas: reference
  distillate: reference
  uranium: reference

# Map technology names to fuel names. The fuel names should match the 'fuel'
# column values in your fuel price table.

  Petroleum Liquids: distillate

# The CCS fuel names (key values on right have to be in the format <fuel>_<ccslevel>,
# where the fuel matches something from "fuel_scenarios" above)

# ============================================================================
# LEGACY MAPPING PARAMETERS (OPTIONAL - NOT USED IN THIS TEST SYSTEM)
# ============================================================================
# The parameters below are only needed if you're using fuel price data directly
# from EIA AEO with region/fuel/scenario codes that need to be mapped to your
# preferred names. If your fuel price table already uses the region, scenario,
# and fuel names you want, you can omit these entirely.
#
# When to use these legacy parameters:
# - Working with raw AEO data files with codes like "PCF", "STC", "REF2025"
# - Need to map AEO census divisions to multiple model regions
# - Using regional_fuel_adjustments to modify prices by region
#
# Example legacy parameters (commented out since not needed for simplified approach):
#
# fuel_series_scenario_names:
#   reference: REF2025
#   no_111d: NOCAA111
#
# fuel_series_names:
#   coal: STC
#   naturalgas: NG
#   distillate: DFO
#   uranium: U
#
# fuel_series_region_names:
#   pacific: PCF
#   mountain: MTN
#
# fuel_region_map:
#   pacific: [p1, p2, p3, p4]
#   # ... map AEO regions to model regions
